# Final project

In this project you will be working in a team of three people.

## Important Information

### To-do List
1. Meet with your team members if you haven't done so.
2. Start thinking about what you want to do for your project. The course staff can also suggest potential topics.
3. Mid-term review: in about two weeks the course staff will meet with each team to discuss the project plans, provide feedbacks and give recommendations.

### Due Date
This project is due the last week of this quarter (Sunday, Dec 4 at midnight Chicago time).

You should make sure you have pushed your completed work to GitHub by this time.

### Group Assignment

This is a group assignment.  You will share a `git` repository, and work will be shared.  Evaluation will be done on the group repository, but everyone should understand the code and answers.  You can (and should) look at code that any group member writes and look for ways to improve it, for example, by adding comments, improving docstrings, or catching bugs. You can talk to people in other groups, but shouldn't share code/answers.

You should communicate with your group early on to discuss who will do what, and check in regularly to make sure work is being completed.  You may wish to video chat or use Slack to troubleshoot or debug together.  It is perfectly fine to write code collectively e.g. get on video and "pair program".  Work should be divided roughly equally, and you'll be asked to say who was primarily responsible for what (you don't have to be super detailed).

If you having trouble communicating with members of your group e.g. someone is just not responding to emails at all, please let the course staff know.  In extreme cases, group members may be re-assigned.

If you are new to using git, see [collaboriating with git](https://github.com/caam37830-fall-2022/git-tutorial/blob/main/collaborating.md).  It is recommended to use a branch for each team member.
