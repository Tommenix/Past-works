# Past-works
This is a compilation of my past works, most of which from my master at MCAM at UChicago.

Now there's many folders here. The they are listed in this manner:

In the "1 class 1 file" folder, you will see files that are detailed recorders of class notes, remarks, and personal understandings. They are typically 50-80 pages long since they cover all materials from a whole semester.

In the file that starts with a topic/class name you will see the class note PDF (if applicable) and homeworks(original version and my responces). Also, if the class has a final project, it is included in the file too.

Below is a list of links to published works that I've participated in:
